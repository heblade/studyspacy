From Liverpool to Beijing. The most successful and legendary band of the 20th century, the Beatles, 55 years have landed in China, not with the fabulous four guys of course, but their music! It is hard to define how many fans the Beatles have in China, and it is even harder to pick one favorite song from their massive output.

"Love Me Do...too many songs that I love and it is hard to find one. When we were teenage boys, we earned a lot of money by covering the Beatles songs in bars. I think they have great imaginations," singer and songwriter Hao Yun said.

"Because from Abbey Road. It is the last song the four guys sing together, and it is a sad song," Kong Yang, the lead vocals of the band Life Journey said. "The Beatles let me know how to think about life and the world. I would not be so confident and I would not dare to do a lot of things without them."

On March 22, 1963, the foursome released their first album and kicked off a legendary journey in the music world. And on the same day 55 years later, all the 28 studio recording albums of their heydays were formally announced a release on Xiami, the digital music platform, in succession, and in physical CDs and vinyls.

Musicians, media figures and music company bosses were invited to sit together, watching the Abbey Road documentary and share their stories about the Beatles.

Apart from the music, the exhibition is also a panoramic look back into the Beatles' golden eras, to comfort Chinese fans of the years they missed.

Over a hundred photographs, videos and posters from their very beginning to the dismission are on their first display in China, taking visitors and music enthusiasts travel back in time.

The Beatles have redefined pop music and music record industry, and is still changing people's mind and the music world. The exhibition runs until May 27.
